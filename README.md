### Project : Image Segmentation 

<strong>Using K-means algorithm, I have extracted the  K most dominant colour of the image, Where k is the input received from User.
It is a basic application of the K-Means algorithm, where, the algorithm tries to find out K-most dominant colours, in the pixel array, and then
the new or modified picture is created by replacing the nearest colour value, among the k most dominant colours, to give a completely new image made up of,
these colours.</strong>

### NOTE :
<strong>
I have used K = 6 (here) but the program is generic,and you can give any positive integer upto 255 to it.<br><br>
