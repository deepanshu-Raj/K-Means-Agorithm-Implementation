# K-Means-Agorithmic-Implementation
code for K-means Algorithm from scratch.

# Project : Image Segmentation 
  
  <p>Using K-means algorithm, i have extracted the  K most dominant colour if the image, Where k is the input from User.
  It is a basic application of the K-Means algorithm, where, the algorithm tries to find out K-most dominant colours, in the pixel array, and then
  the new or modified picture is created by replacing the nearest colour value, among the k most dominant colours, to give a completely new image made up of,
  these colours.</p>

  <h3> - I have used K = 6 (here) but the program is generic, you can give any value to it.</h3>
  <h3>And the (K=6) most dominant colours are :</h3>
